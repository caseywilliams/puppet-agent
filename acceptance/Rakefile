USAGE
  Required Settings or Environment Variables
    SHA='sha'
       Supply git ref (sha or tag) of packages of puppet-agent to be put under test.
       Also supports the literal string 'latest' which references the latest
       build on #{DEFAULT_NIGHTLIES_DOWNLOAD_URL}.
       If setting SHA to 'latest', you must also set ENV['AGENT_DOWNLOAD_URL'] to
       #{DEFAULT_NIGHTLIES_DOWNLOAD_URL}.

  Optional Settings or Environment Variables
    BEAKER_HOSTS=config/nodes/foo.yaml
      Supply the path to a yaml file in the format of a beaker hosts file containing
      the test targets, roles, etc., or specify it in a beaker options.rb file.

    TEST_TARGET='beaker-hostgenerator target'
      Supply a test target in the form beaker-hostgenerator accepts, e.g.
      ubuntu1504-64a. Defaults to #{DEFAULT_TEST_TARGETS}.

    AGENT_DOWNLOAD_URL='http://example.com'
      Supply the url of the host serving packages of puppet-agent to test matching
      `SHA`. Ignored by `rake acceptance:released` which always downloads from
      public production Puppet repositories.
      Valid values are:
        * #{DEFAULT_INTERNAL_DOWNLOAD_URL} (Puppet internal builds)
        * #{DEFAULT_NIGHTLIES_DOWNLOAD_URL} (Puppet public nightly builds)

      Default: #{DEFAULT_INTERNAL_DOWNLOAD_URL}.

    TESTS='path/to/test,and/more/tests'
      Supply a comma-separated string (no spaces) of specific test(s) to run.
      All pre-suites will be run, unless a specific pre-suite file is supplied as the
      value to this option, in which case test exercise will terminate after the
      supplied pre-suite file.

    OPTIONS='--more --options'
      Supply additional options to pass to the beaker invocation

If there is a Beaker options hash in a ./local_options.rb, it will be included.
Commandline options set through the above environment variables will override
settings in this file.
